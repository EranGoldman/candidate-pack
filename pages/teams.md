# Our engineering teams 💻

We are firm believers that our teams should have autonomy and ownership of their work, and of the entire platform too.\
With great power, comes great responsibility! 💪 \
Our teams are responsible for every aspect of the work they are delivering, including testing, deployment and infrastructure. This gives our engineers a wide variety of challenges and growth opportunities.\
Our team structure is organised with end-to-end ownership in mind.

## TL;DR
Our teams work closely together to solve complex problems on our market leading, cloud native payment processing platform. \
To use a simple train analogy, we can summarise the work our teams do as: 
- The platform teams build the train tracks 🛤
- The tooling teams provide us with the best tools for building tracks and trains 🛠
- The core teams build the trains that run on the tracks 🚆
- The markets teams extend the trains and tracks to serve customers in multiple locations 🌎
- The InfoSec teams make sure the train and tracks remain secure, during the maintenance and building process 🔐

## Platform 🛤
Our platform teams build, run and maintain our cloud native systems. The teams play a crucial role ensuring the reliability and scalability of our entire platform. \
Here are some of the exciting things they do: 
- Deliver and maintain our highly resilient, highly available, secure platform
- Work with Cockroach DB and Cilium to build our next generation platform running accross multiple public clouds
- Build and run our FPS data centers as an extension of our cloud solutions using Kubernetes, Cilium and NATS

## Tooling 🛠
Internal tools are a priority here at Form3, as they help our engineers deliver software at speed. Our tooling teams build and maintain our extensive developer tooling ecosystem.\
Here are some of the exciting things they do:
- Build, deploy and maintain Form3's internal tooling to enable 
- Provide secure and reliable internal tools using Go, Terraform and various open-source tools to enable all our engineers to deliver globally
- Work together with other teams to identify, gather requirements and deliver tools that improve our development and delivery processes

## Core 🚆
Our core teams build, run and maintain functional capabilities and services enabling successful payment processing on our platform.\
Here are some of the exciting things they do: 
- Develop and maintain shared functionality on our secure, multitenant systems through a mix of Java and Go development
- Actively improve our low latency, high throughput distributed payment processing architecture
- Ensure the complete monitoring and alerting of all our services using Prometheus and Grafana

## Markets 🌎
Our markets teams build and run payment processing services in UK, Europe and internationally. We support a wide variety of payment processing schemes such as FPS, BACS, SEPA, SWIFT and more.\
Here are some of the exciting things they do:
- Deliver payment products to their markets using the Form3 platform 
- Maintain and implement the integrations between our platform and external payment scheme providers using Java and Go
- Work on client functionality, ensuring the stability of our services and APIs that our customers integrate with

## InfoSec 🔒
Form3 have an extensive team of defensive and offensive engineering teams that work together with our security officers.\
Our security teams work closely together with all our other engineering teams to ensure that we maintain the highest standards of security on our platform.
