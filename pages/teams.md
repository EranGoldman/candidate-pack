# Our engineering teams ðŸ’»

We are firm believers that our teams should have autonomy and ownership of their work, and of the entire platform too.\
With great power, comes great responsibility! ðŸ’ª \
Our teams are responsible for every aspect of the work they are delivering, including testing, deployment and infrastructure. This gives our engineers a wide variety of challenges and growth opportunities.\
Our team structure is organised with end-to-end ownership in mind.
