## The technical coding task
We have opted for a take home coding task over a live coding exercise to allow our candidates to deliver their best work on their own timeline. This means that there is no deadline to our technical task.

There are two coding tasks, depending on the role you are being considered for: 
- The [software engineer coding task](https://github.com/form3tech-oss/interview-accountapi) focuses on the API design and implementation of a sample application. 
- The [platform engineer coding task](https://github.com/form3tech-oss/platform-interview) focuses on the infrastructure configuration of a sample application. 

Please do not attempt this exercise until you have spoken with a member of Form3's Talent Team.
